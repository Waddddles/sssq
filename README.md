# Search water conditions

As my frist project, the codes sucks, there are no comments, no simplification, and no good sub packaging function.

Its only function is to crawl water information from several fixed websites.

Operation method:

1.install dependent Libraries, such as bs4, re, requests, csv, etc.

2.run a_control.py

it will return you some water conditions in some CSV files.
